## Local Development Setup
### üõ≥ Container Setup 
1. Run `docker-compose up` to setup project.
2. Run `docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py migrate`
3. Create an `.env` file from `sample.env`

### üì¶ Database Restore

If you'd like to restore a database dump leave out step 2 of the setup. Instead copy your
database dump into the database container and restore it:

```bash
docker cp ./local_path/to/db/dump [db-container-name]:/db_dump.bin
docker exec [db-container-name] pg_restore -U postgres -d postgres /backup/db_dump
```

The database container name can be retrieved by runnning `docker ps`.

Depending on the age of your database dump there may be new database migrations
which are not yet reflected in the database dump. This is usually the case when 
you're experiencing a `ProgrammingError` after restoring a database dump.

In that simply execute Django's migration command in the web container:
```bash
docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py migrate
```

At this point all content is available but not yet indexed for the search.
Setup Solr and run following command to index all contents:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py rebuild_index
```

### üñº Media File Restore
If you would like to restore the media files on your local development setup simply create 
a directory called `media` within the `dll` directory (`project_dir/dll/media/`) and copy 
`filer_public` as well as `filer_public_thumbnails` into it.

### ü¶∏ Superuser creation

You can create a super user by running the following command:
```bash
docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Please note the first and last name are mandatory fields. Leaving both fields empty may
cause problems.

### üêç Python Shell Access 

In some cases it is useful to be able to access the Python shell of the web container:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py shell_plus
```

The `shell_plus` is a part of the `django-extensions` package. It automatically imports 
all project relevant models and some helper functions.

### Solr 8.2

#### Setup
Instruct solr to use the `schema.xml` file:
- add `<schemaFactory class="ClassicIndexSchemaFactory"/>` in the solrconfig.xml
- remove the `AddSchemaFieldsUpdateProcessorFactory` section from `solrconfig.xml` ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31719955/solr-error-this-indexschema-is-not-mutable))

#### Update the schema
- `python manage.py build_solr_schema -f solr/conf/schema.xml`

### Testing

The digital.learning.lab platform comes with a testsuite, which can simply be 
extended and executed:

```bash
docker-compose exec web coverage run --source=/code/dll/ -m pytest /code/dll/
```
