## Local Development Setup
### Container Setup üõ≥
1. Run `docker-compose up` to setup project.
2. Run `docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py migrate`


### Database Restore üì¶

If you'd like to restore a database dump leave out step 2 of the setup. Instead copy your
database dump into the database container and restore it:

```bash
docker cp ./local_path/to/db/dump [db-container-name]:/backup/db_dump
docker exec [db-container-name] pg_restore -U postgres -d postgres /backup/db_dump
```

The database container name can be retrieved by runnning `docker ps`.

### Media File Restore üñº
If you would like to restore the media files on your local development setup simply create 
a directory called `media` within the `dll` directory (`project_dir/dll/media/`) and copy 
`filer_public` as well as `filer_public_thumbnails` into it.

### Superuser creation ü¶∏‚Äç

You can create a super user by running the following command:
```bash
docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Please note the first and last name are mandatory fields. Leaving both fields empty may
cause problems.

### Python Shell Access üêç

In some cases it is useful to be able to access the Python shell of the web container:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py shell_plus
```

The `shell_plus` is a part of the `django-extensions` package. It automatically imports 
all project relevant models and some helper functions.

### Solr 8.2

#### Setup
Instruct solr to use the `schema.xml` file:
- add `<schemaFactory class="ClassicIndexSchemaFactory"/>` in the solrconfig.xml

### Update the schema
- `python manage.py build_solr_schema -f solr/conf/schema.xml`
